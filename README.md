Do you know how much your PR costs?

## Introduction

This should be an end-to-end solution for development management using Github, Slack and mail. The mantra is "Keep it simple", we want to focus in development, not in management tools, time tracking and so on.

## Slack bot

Our main point of contact. We want to have the following features:

### Daily meetings

- [ ] Launch the bot periodically and print a message
- [ ] Make the questions to all members
- [ ] Store the response of each member
- [ ] Package it as an Slack App (ready to deal with OAuth?)
- [ ] Some improvements to the bot (icon, etc.)
- [ ] Put in docker and automatic deployment (Travis?)

### Ask for reports 

- [ ] Define scope
- [ ] Send by email

### Make exceptions 

- [ ] Reminders: team member X is on holidays, fill your hours, etc.

## Github bot

We want to know how much time has been spent for an specific PR.

### Github bot TODO

- [ ] Define scope

## Trello board

Have a board where we can prioritized our issues, see PR associated and so on.

### Trello board TODO

- [ ] Define scope
